# timer

## What is it ?
**timer** is a LÃ¶ve framework library that handle doing action under certain conditions.
I use it to deal with boolean farms when coding complex behaviors for my games.

It's build around [chrono.lua](https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/chrono) and [hump.timer](https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/timer.lua).
Like those two libraries it also handle tweening values.

This library have functions that can be separated in 2 types:
- **Timing functions**: Do an action after/during/every amount of time
- **Update loop functions**: Do an action once, every XX update loop



## API
- **Timer:update(dt)**: Put this in the love.update function.

Update the internal of one timer, put this in your **love.update** function.

- **Timer:after(time, action[, after, tag])**:
  - **time**   = number
  - **action** = function 
  - **after**  = function 
  - **tag**    = string

After an amount of time (in seconds), execute the action function and then the after function.

- **Timer:every(time, action[, count, after, tag])**:
  - **time** = number
  - **action** = function 
  - **count** = number
  - **after** = function 
  - **tag**  = string

Every amount of time, execute the action function.
If there is a count parameter, the every function will execute this number of time then stop then call the after function.
If the action function return false, the every function will stop then call the after function.

- **Timer:during(time, action[, each, after, tag])**:
  - **time** = number
  - **action** = function
  - **each**   = number
  - **after**  = function 
  - **tag**    = string

During an amount of time, execute the action function every **each** number of update loop then execute the after function. 
By default, the action function is called every frame.

- **Timer:tween(time, subject, target, method[,after, tag])**:
  - **time** = number
  - **subject** = table
  - **target**   = table
  - **after**  = function 
  - **tag**    = string
  
 In an amount of time, tween all the values of the table **subject** to the **target** values.
 At the end of the tween the values wil be **exactly** equal to the target values.
