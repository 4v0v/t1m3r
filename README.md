# timer

## What is it ?
**timer** is a LÃ¶ve framework library that handle doing action under certain conditions.
I was tired to deal with boolean farms when trying to code complex behaviors for my games.

It's build around [chrono.lua](https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/chrono) and [hump.timer](https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/timer.lua).
Like those two libraries it also handle tweening values.

This library have functions that can be separated in 2 types:
- **Timing functions**: Do an action after/during/every amount of time
- **Update loop functions**: Do an action once, every XX update loop



## API
- **Timer:update(dt)**: Put this in the love.update function.

- **Timer:after(time, action[, after, tag])**:
  - time   = number
  - action = function 
  - after  = function 
  - tag    = string

After an amount of time (in seconds), execute the action function and then the after function.
